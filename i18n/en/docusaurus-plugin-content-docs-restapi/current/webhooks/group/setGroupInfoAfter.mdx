# Callback After Modifying Group Information

## Function Description
The App business server can use this callback to real-time view changes in group information, including: notifying the App backend about member joining and real-time recording of changes in group information (such as logging or syncing with other systems).

## Precautions
- To enable the callback, you must configure the callback URL and activate the switch corresponding to this callback protocol. See the [Callback Description](../introduction) document for configuration methods.
- The direction of the callback is an HTTP/HTTPS POST request initiated by OpenIM Server to the App backend.
- The App business server needs to verify whether the command parameter in the request URL is its own SDKNAME parameter after receiving the callback request.
- The APP business server is required to respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Callback
- App users request to modify group information through the client.
- App administrators change group information through the REST API.

## Timing of the Callback
- After OpenIM Server completes the operation to modify group information.
