## 🚀 Using the Demo
We strongly recommend that you first run the framework-specific sample [DEMO](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-electron-demo) we have prepared for you. This will not only give you a firsthand experience of OpenIMSDK's features but will also assist you in quickly identifying and resolving issues during the actual integration process.

## Integration Steps (Webpack5+)

### 1. Add Dependencies

```bash
npm install open-im-sdk-wasm
```

### 2. Obtain the static resources required for wasm

> In the `node_modules` directory at the root of your project, find the `open-im-sdk-wasm` sub-directory and copy all files from the `assets` folder to the public resources directory of your project (public).

- File list:

```bash
openIM.wasm
sql-wasm.wasm
wasm_exec.js
```

- After copying, include the `wasm_exec.js` file in your `index.html` via the script tag.

### 3. Import SDK

- Import SDK

```ts
import { getSDK } from 'open-im-sdk-wasm';

const OpenIM = getSDK();
```

- Potential issue you might encounter
  ![webpack5_error](./assets/webpack5_error.png)

- Solution
  > Add the following configuration in the webpack setup:

```bash
resolve: {
      fallback: {
        path: false,
        crypto: false,
      },
    },
```

## Integration Steps (Vite, Webpack4)

> The first and second steps are the same as the Webpack5+ integration steps mentioned above.

### Import SDK

#### Copy the lib directory from the npm package to your project, such as: src/utils/lib

#### If using Webpack4, you also need to import the worker loader:

- Install `worker-loader` and `worker-plugin`

```bash
npm install worker-loader worker-plugin -D
```

- Add the following configuration in webpack:

```js
const WorkerPlugin = require("worker-plugin");

...
plugins: [new WorkerPlugin()]
...
```

#### Modify the import method of web worker in the lib/api/index.js file.

- For Webpack4.x:

```js
+ import IMWorker from 'worker-loader!./worker.js';

- worker = new Worker(new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url));
+ worker = new IMWorker();
```

- For Vite:

```js
+ import IMWorker from './worker?worker';

- worker = new Worker(new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url));
+ worker = new IMWorker();
```

#### Importing

> The path is where the `lib` was placed after copying

```ts
import { getSDK } from '@/utils/lib';

const OpenIM = getSDK();
```
