## 🚀 Usage Demo
We strongly recommend that you first run the framework-related examples we have prepared for you [DEMO](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-uniapp-demo). This will not only allow you to intuitively experience the functionality of OpenIMSDK but also help you quickly identify and resolve issues during the actual integration process.

## Tips

### 1. Server Preparation

- If you are using the [pure JS version SDK](/sdks/quickstart/miniProgram), besides deploying `OpenIM Server`, you also need to deploy [OIMWS](/guides/gettingStarted/jssdk).

### 2. Development for H5/Mini Programs Only

- If you are developing for H5 and Mini Programs (or native Mini Programs) using uniapp, simply use the [pure JS version SDK](/sdks/quickstart/miniProgram) ***without*** following the steps below.

## Integration Steps

Including APP-side development, it is **essential** to follow the steps below to import the SDK using cloud plugins and npm packages. This is because the implementation for the APP side is done through [App Native Language Plugins](https://uniapp.dcloud.net.cn/plugin/native-plugin.html).

### 1. Add Dependencies

> Official plugins have been uploaded to the [dcloud plugin market](https://ext.dcloud.net.cn/plugin?id=6577).

- Choose the corresponding project and package name to import the SDK.

![uni_import](./assets/uni_import.png)

- Open the `manifest.json` file in the root directory of the imported SDK project, select **App Native Plugin Configuration**, and import the cloud plugin.

![uni_import_manifest](./assets/uni_import_manifest.png)

- Download the npm package to simplify the import and use of the SDK and wrap the API in Promise form.

> For versions of openim-uniapp-polyfill >= 1.2.0, use the [pure JS version SDK](/sdks/quickstart/miniProgram) for non-APP platforms.

```bash
npm install openim-uniapp-polyfill open-im-sdk
```

### 2. Import in Project (Pure APP Project)

```javascript
import IMSDK from 'openim-uniapp-polyfill';

IMSDK.asyncApi('login', IMSDK.uuid(), {
  userID: '123',
  token: 'token',
});

const onConnectSuccess = () => {
  // Connection successful
};
// Set up listener
IMSDK.subscribe(IMSDK.IMEvents.OnConnectSuccess, onConnectSuccess);
// Unsubscribe listener
IMSDK.unsubscribe(IMSDK.IMEvents.OnConnectSuccess, onConnectSuccess);
```

### 3. Import in Project (APP + H5/Mini Program Project)

> You need to use cloud plugins to import the SDK. For the new npm package, use the [pure JS version SDK](/sdks/quickstart/miniProgram) for non-APP platforms.

- Note 1: `openim-uniapp-polyfill` version should be >= 1.2.0

- Note 2: Use uniapp's method to call listeners, passing in methods from `IMSDK.IMEvents`, as there is a difference in case sensitivity between JSSDK and APP. This conversion is already handled in the npm package.

- Note 3: In some APIs, there may be differences between platforms due to platform support. When using them, check the documentation for the respective platform's API and note the differences:
  - Depending on the platform, pass the correct `platformID`.
  - Login API parameters may vary.
  - On Android/iOS, you need to call [initSDK](/sdks/api/initialization/initSDK) before using it.
  - Creating image and file messages uses different APIs, so use **conditional compilation** to call different methods.
  - And so on...

#### 3.1 Usage in Cross-Platform Scenarios

> Method 1: If parameters and method names are consistent across platforms, use uniapp's method to call them.

- This is a multi-platform compatible approach. In cross-platform scenarios, check if the API return content structure is consistent.

```javascript
import IMSDK from 'openim-uniapp-polyfill';

IMSDK.asyncApi('createTextMessage', IMSDK.uuid(), 'text')
  .then((data) => {
    // do something
  })
```

> Method 2: If parameters and method names differ across platforms, use [conditional compilation](https://uniapp.dcloud.net.cn/tutorial/platform.html) to handle significant parameter differences.

- For the APP platform, you need to call [initSDK](/sdks/api/initialization/initSDK) before using it.

```javascript
import IMSDK from 'openim-uniapp-polyfill';

// #ifdef H5 || MP-WEIXIN
IMSDK.asyncApi('login', IMSDK.uuid(), {
  userID : '123',
  token: 'token',
  platformID: 5,
  wsAddr: 'ws://your-server-ip:10003',
  apiAddr: 'http://your-server-ip:10002',
});
// #endif

// #ifdef APP-PLUS
IMSDK.asyncApi('login', IMSDK.uuid(), {
  userID: '123',
  token: 'token',
});
// #endif
```

### 4. 🛠️ Local Development

#### 4.1 Create Custom Debug Base

> Note: The package name needs to match the package name set when importing cloud plugins in the first step.

![uni_build](./assets/uni_build.png)

#### 4.2. Run on Custom Debug Base

> When debugging the APP side locally, you must package a custom base and start debugging on it.

![uni_run](./assets/uni_run.png)

### 5. 🚀 Build and Release

> For APP platform packaging and release, use Release -> Native APP Cloud Packaging.
