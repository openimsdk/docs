# Callback Before Updating User Information

## Function Description
The App business server can use this callback to receive requests from users to update their personal information. Additionally, the business server can modify and intervene in the request.

## Precautions
- To enable the callback, it is necessary to configure the callback URL and activate the corresponding switch for this callback protocol. Configuration methods can be found in the [Callback Explanation](../introduction) document.
- The direction of the callback is an HTTP/HTTPS POST request initiated by OpenIM Server to the App backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the App business server must verify whether the command parameter in the request URL is its SDKNAME parameter.
- The APP business server must respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Callback
- App users update their personal information through the client.
- App administrators update user information through the REST API.

## Timing of the Callback
- Before OpenIM Server prepares to update user information.
