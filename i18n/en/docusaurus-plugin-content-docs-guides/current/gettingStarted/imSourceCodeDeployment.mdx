## For deployment of release-v3.6 and earlier versions
## 2. Deploy OpenIM Server (IM)

### 2.1 📡 Set OPENIM_IP


🔔 **It is mandatory to set OPENIM_IP, and it cannot be 127.0.0.1**

```
# If the server has an external IP
export OPENIM_IP="external IP"

# If providing only internal network services
export OPENIM_IP="internal IP"
```







### 2.2 🏗️ Deploy Components (mongodb/redis/zookeeper/kafka/MinIO, etc.)

```
git clone https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/open-im-server && cd open-im-server 
# It is recommended to switch to the release-v3.6 or later release branches
make init && docker compose up -d

```

### 2.3 🛠️ Compilation

```
make build

```

### 2.4 🚀 Start/Stop/Check

```jsx
# Start
make start
# Stop
make stop
# Check
make check

```

## 3. Deploying App Server (Chat)

### 3.1 🏗️ Clone chat repository
```
#Return to the previous directory
cd ..
# Clone repository, it is recommended to switch to release-v1.6 or later release branches
git clone https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/chat chat && cd chat
```

### 3.2 🛠️ Compilation

## 6. About Configuring Items

### 6.1 🛠️ Modifying Common Configuration Items

| Configuration Item | File to be Modified | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mongo/kafka/minio related | .env, openim-server/config/config.yaml | Need to restart components and IM |
| redis/zookeeper related | .env, openim-server/config/config

.yaml, chat/config/config.yaml | Need to restart components, IM, and Chat |
| SECRET | openim-server/config/config.yaml, chat/config/config.yaml | Need to restart IM and Chat |

### 6.2 🔄 Special Items in Common Configuration

Special configuration items: API_OPENIM_PORT/MINIO_PORT/OPENIM_IP/GRAFANA_PORT

1. Modify the special configuration items in the `.env` file
2. Modify the configuration in **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`** according to the rules

```jsx
object:
  apiURL: "http://$OPENIM_IP:$API_OPENIM_PORT"
  minio:
    endpoint: "http://$DOCKER_BRIDGE_GATEWAY:$MINIO_PORT"
    signEndpoint: "http://$OPENIM_IP:$MINIO_PORT"

grafanaUrl: http://$OPENIM_IP:$GRAFANA_PORT
```


3. Modify the configuration in **`chat/config/config.yaml`** according to the rules

```jsx
If IM is not on the same machine as Chat, replace 127.0.0.1 with the IP of the machine where IM is located
openIMUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:$API_OPENIM_PORT"
```



4. Restart IM and Chat

### 6.3 🛠️ Modifying Other Configuration Items

For other configuration items in **`.env`**, **`chat/config/config.yaml`**, and **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`**, you can modify these items individually in the respective files.


### 6.4 Modifying Ports
Especially note that any port modification related to IM also needs to be synchronized with the ports in open-im-server/scripts/install/environment.sh

## 7. Common Issues

### 7.1 📜 Viewing Logs

Log locations:

- Runtime logs, to be viewed for problem resolution after successful startup: `_output/logs/openim-all*`
- Startup logs, to be checked if there are errors during startup: `_output/logs/openim-*.log`



### 7.2 🚀 Startup Sequence

The startup sequence is as follows:

- Components dependent on IM: mongo/redis/kafka/zookeeper/minio, etc.
- **IM**
- **Chat**

### 7.3 🐳 Docker Version

The new version of Docker has integrated docker-compose. Older versions of Docker may not support the gateway feature❌. We recommend upgrading to a newer version, such as `23.0.1`🔝
