# 🛠 Source Code Deployment

## 1. Environment and Component Requirements
For server environment, system, and storage components, refer to [this document](./env-comp).

---

## 2. Deploying OpenIM Server (IM)

### 2.1 📡 Setting OPENIM_IP

🔔 **It is mandatory to set OPENIM_IP, and it cannot be 127.0.0.1**

```jsx
# If the server has a public IP
export OPENIM_IP="Public IP"

# If only providing internal network service
export OPENIM_IP="Internal IP"
```


### 2.2 🏗️ Deploying Components (mongodb/redis/zookeeper/kafka/MinIO, etc.)

```
git clone https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/open-im-server && cd open-im-server
# It's recommended to switch to the release-v3.5 or later release branches
make init && docker compose up -d
```

### 2.3 🛠️ Compiling

```
make build
```

### 2.4 🚀 Starting/Stopping/Checking

```jsx
# Start
make start
# Stop
make stop
# Check
make check
```

## 3. Deploying App Server (Chat)

### 3.1 🏗️ Deploying Components (mysql)

```
# Return to the previous directory
cd ..
# Clone the repository. It's recommended to switch to the release-v1.5 or later release branches
git clone https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/chat chat && cd chat
# Deploy mysql
docker run -d --name mysql2 -p 13306:3306 -p 33306:33060 -v "$(pwd)/components/mysql/data:/var/lib/mysql" -v "/etc/localtime:/etc/localtime" -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="openIM123" --restart always mysql:5.7
```

### 3.2 🛠️ Compiling

```
make init
make build
```

### 3.3 🚀 Starting/Stopping/Checking

```jsx
# Start
make start
# Stop
make stop
# Check
make check
```

## 4. Quick Verification

Please refer to the [Quick Verification](./quickTestServer) document.

## 5. Admin Panel and Monitoring System

Please refer to the [Admin Panel and Monitoring System](./admin) document.

## 6. About Modifying Configuration Items

### 6.1 🛠️ Modifying Shared Configuration Items

| Configuration Item | Files to Modify | Operation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mongo/kafka/minio related | .env, openim-server/config/config.yaml | Need to restart components and IM |
| redis/zookeeper related | .env, openim-server/config/config.yaml, chat/config/config.yaml | Need to restart components, IM, and Chat |
| SECRET | openim-server/config/config.yaml, chat/config/config.yaml | Need to restart IM and Chat |

### 6.2 🔄 Modifying Special Shared Configuration Items

Special configuration items: API_OPENIM_PORT/MINIO_PORT/OPENIM_IP/GRAFANA_PORT

1. Modify the special configuration items in the `.env` file.
2. Modify configurations in **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`** as per rules:

```jsx
object:
  apiURL: "http://$OPENIM_IP:$API_OPENIM_PORT"
  minio:
    endpoint: "http://$DOCKER_BRIDGE_GATEWAY:$MINIO_PORT"
    signEndpoint: "http://$OPENIM_IP:$MINIO_PORT"

grafanaUrl: http://$OPENIM_IP:$GRAFANA_PORT
```

3. Modify configurations in **`chat/config/config.yaml`** as per rules:

```jsx
openIMUrl: "http://172.28.0.1:$API_OPENIM_PORT"
```

4. Restart IM and Chat

### 6.3 🛠️ Modifying Other Configuration Items

For other configuration items in **`.env`**, **`chat/config/config.yaml`**, and **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`**, these can be modified individually in the respective files.

### 6.4 Modifying Ports
Especially note that any modification of IM-related ports needs to be synchronized with the ports in open-im-server/scripts/install/environment.sh.

## 7. Common Issues

### 7.1 📜 Viewing Logs

Log Locations:

- Runtime logs, for troubleshooting after successful startup: `logs/OpenIM.log.all.*`
- Startup logs, for checking in case of errors during startup: `_output/logs/openim_*.log`

### 7.2 🚀 Startup Sequence

The startup sequence is as follows:

- Components IM depends on: mongo/redis/kafka/zookeeper/minio, etc.
- **IM**
- Components Chat depends on: mysql
- **Chat**

### 7.3 🐳

 Docker Version

The newer version of Docker has integrated docker-compose. Older versions of Docker may not support the gateway feature❌. We recommend upgrading to a newer version, such as `23.0.1`🔝.
