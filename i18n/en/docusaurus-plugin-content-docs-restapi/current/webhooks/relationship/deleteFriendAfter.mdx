# Callback After Deleting a Friend

## Function Description
The App business server can use this callback to real-time monitor information about users deleting friends.

## Precautions
- To enable the callback, it is necessary to configure the callback URL and activate the corresponding switch for this callback protocol. Configuration methods can be found in the [Callback Explanation](../introduction) document.
- The direction of the callback is an HTTP/HTTPS POST request initiated by OpenIM Server to the App backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the App business server must verify whether the command parameter in the request URL is its SDKNAME parameter.
- The APP business server must respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Callback
- App users delete friends through the client.
- App administrators delete friends through the REST API.

## Timing of the Callback
- After OpenIM Server receives and successfully processes a delete friend request.
