# Callback After Setting Group Member Information

## Function Description
The App business server can use this callback to obtain requests for setting group member information, allowing the App to perform necessary data synchronization.

## Precautions
- To enable the callback, it is required to configure the callback URL and turn on the switch corresponding to this callback protocol. For configuration methods, see the [Callback Explanation](../introduction) document.
- The callback is an HTTP/HTTPS POST request initiated by OpenIM Server to the App backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the App business server must verify whether the command parameter in the request URL matches its SDKNAME parameter.
- The APP business server must respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Callback
- Group administrators successfully modify group member-related information through the client.

## Timing of the Callback
- After OpenIM Server updates group member information.
